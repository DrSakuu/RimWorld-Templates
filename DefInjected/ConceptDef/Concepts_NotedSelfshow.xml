  <Stockpiles.helpText>Your colonists need somewhere to store items. Designate a STOCKPILE for them to store things.\n\nFind the stockpile in the ZONES section of the ARCHITECT menu in the lower-left.</Stockpiles.helpText>

  <Forbidding.label>Forbid and unforbid</Forbidding.label>
  <Forbidding.helpText>Colonists will not interact with items marked FORBIDDEN.\n\nForbidden items have a small red X attached. Select a forbidden item and use the controls at the bottom to UNFORBID it.</Forbidding.helpText>

  <ForbiddingDoors.label>Forbidding doors</ForbiddingDoors.label>
  <ForbiddingDoors.helpText>You can FORBID doors so colonists and tame animals won't go through them.\n\nNote that this isn't a door lock. Doors are always locked, so enemies can't pass freely. Forbidding just directs your colonists not to use the door. Colonists who are going crazy might use the door anyway.</ForbiddingDoors.helpText>

  <CoverAndShooting.label>Cover and shooting</CoverAndShooting.label>
  <CoverAndShooting.helpText>The most important thing to do in ranged combat is to use cover.\n\nCover only works if your colonist is touching it, and it is between your colonist and the enemy.\n\nYou can also place colonists behind wall corners. They will lean out to shoot.\n\nMost things can be used as cover, but some things are better than others. Hiding behind a tree is better than nothing, but hiding behind sandbags is better than using a tree.</CoverAndShooting.helpText>

  <AllowedAreas.label>Allowed areas</AllowedAreas.label>
  <AllowedAreas.helpText>Colonists and colony animals can be assigned to ALLOWED AREAS. This forbids them from taking destinations outside their allowed area.\n\nThis can be used to, for example, forbid colonists from going outside.\n\nYou can create multiple allowed areas and assign them to different colonists and animals.\n\nCreate, delete, and assign allowed areas in the RESTRICT tab.\n\nPaint allowed areas onto the map using the EXPAND ALLOWED AREA and CLEAR ALLOWED AREA designators in the Architect tab.</AllowedAreas.helpText>

  <ManualWorkPriorities.helpText>One of the most important parts of RimWorld is choosing good work settings for your colonists.\n\nPoor work settings can leave essential work unfinished for a long time while colonists waste time on unimportant tasks.\n\nTo give more control over what work colonists do, you can use the Manual Priorities mode in the WORK tab.\n\nIn this mode, each colonist has a priority number for each work type. Colonists will do priority 1 work from left to right, then priority 2 work from left to right, and so on.\n\nIntelligent use of these setting is essential for a large, well-automated colony.</ManualWorkPriorities.helpText>

  <GettingMoreTraders.label>Getting more traders</GettingMoreTraders.label>

  <Outfits.label>Outfits</Outfits.label>

  <FirePreparation.label>Fire preparation</FirePreparation.label>
  <FirePreparation.helpText>Fires can easily burn down a colony. To defeat them, you must prepare before they happen.
\nThese design elements can help reduce the damage from fires:
\n1. Instead of constructing one super-building, build separate buildings with spaces in between.
\n2. Use less flammable materials. Wood is cheap and fast - but very flammable.
\n3. Build firebreaks to stop wildfires approaching your base. A strip of concrete floor 3 or 4 cells wide will generally stop an advancing fire.</FirePreparation.helpText>

The tooltip will show the chance to hit, and a breakdown of the contribution of various to-hit chance multipliers.</ShotAccuracyTooltip.helpText>

  <FriendlyFireSafety.label>Friendly fire safety</FriendlyFireSafety.label>
  <FriendlyFireSafety.helpText>Friendly fire never occurs if the shooter is close to their ally.\n\nFor example, you can safely put a sword-wielding colonist directly in front of a gun-wielding one. The shooter will fire over his friend's shoulder.\n\nThis is a good way to combine ranged and melee fighters.</FriendlyFireSafety.helpText>
