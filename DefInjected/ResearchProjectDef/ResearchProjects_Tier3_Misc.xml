  <Firefoam.label>firefoam</Firefoam.label>
  <Firefoam.description>Allows the construction of firefoam poppers; fire-safety buildings which spread fire-retardant foam in response to encroaching flames.</Firefoam.description>

  <MoisturePump.label>moisture pump</MoisturePump.label>
  <MoisturePump.description>Allows the construction of moisture pumps, which turn wet ground dry.</MoisturePump.description>

  <GeothermalPower.label>geothermal power</GeothermalPower.label>
  <GeothermalPower.description>Allows you to build geothermal power plants on top of steam geysers, for uninterrupted power.</GeothermalPower.description>

  <HospitalBed.label>hospital bed</HospitalBed.label>
  <HospitalBed.description>Allows colonists to construct hospital beds which increase chance of successful medical work.</HospitalBed.description>

  <TransportPod.label>transport pod</TransportPod.label>
  <TransportPod.description>Construct launchable transport pods that you can use to launch people and supplies long distances across the planet's surface.</TransportPod.description>

  <MedicineProduction.label>medicine production</MedicineProduction.label>
  <MedicineProduction.description>Produce medicine from herbal medicine, neutroamine, and cloth.</MedicineProduction.description>

  <MultiAnalyzer.label>multi-analyzer</MultiAnalyzer.label>
  <MultiAnalyzer.description>Allows colonists to build multi-analyzers which increase research speed, and allow higher-level research projects, if placed near a research bench.</MultiAnalyzer.description>

  <LongRangeMineralScanner.label>long-range mineral scanner</LongRangeMineralScanner.label>
  <LongRangeMineralScanner.description>Allows the construction of long-range mineral scanners which automatically detect precious minerals like gold or jade in the nearby areas (but not in which the scanners were built).\n\nThe lumps are found on average once per 30 days within a radius of 30 tiles.\n\nBuilding more than one scanner in the same or nearby areas has little to no effect.</LongRangeMineralScanner.description>
