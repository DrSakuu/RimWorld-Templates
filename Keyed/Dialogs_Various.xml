  <!-- Game updated to new version -->
  <GameUpdatedToNewVersionInitial>RimWorld has been updated from version {0} to version {1}.\n\nThis may cause saved games and mods from the old version to stop working.</GameUpdatedToNewVersionInitial>
  <GameUpdatedToNewVersionNonSteam>Since this is a DRM-free copy, you can install the game twice in two different folders, to be able to play both old and new versions.</GameUpdatedToNewVersionNonSteam>
  <GameUpdatedToNewVersionSteam>If you wish to continue with the old version, you can opt in using Steam's "Betas" feature.\n\n  1. In the Steam library, right-click RimWorld.\n  2. Click Properties.\n  3. Click the Betas tab.\n  4. Select the version you want from the drop-down menu.\n\nOld versions will be likely removed from this list eventually - we just didn't want to cut off games in progress.\n\nNote that if mod authors update their mods for a new game version, they'll probably stop working on an old version. You may want to turn off automatic updates to prevent this.</GameUpdatedToNewVersionSteam>

  <!-- Missing Steam -->
  <SteamClientMissing>Could not initialize Steam API. Possible causes:\n\n-Steam is not running.\n-Launched from outside Steam without steam_appid.txt in place.\n-Running with different privileges than Steam client (e.g. "as administrator").\n\nIn most cases, rebooting your computer will fix this problem.\n\nThis Steam version of the game requires Steam and will now quit.</SteamClientMissing>
