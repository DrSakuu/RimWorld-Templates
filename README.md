RimWorld-Templates
==================

A list of translate-ready files in the correct syntax and some additional scripts. Files are taken from [RimWorld-English](https://github.com/RimWorld-zh/RimWorld-English). For upgrading an existing translation, [RimTrans](https://github.com/duduluu/RimTrans) is recommended.

**Updated for alpha 17!**

With [RimWorld_SimplifyPathTranslations.py](RimWorld_SimplifyPathTranslations.py) you can convert the complex multi line path translations to the new simpler single line format.

With [RimWorld_CompareTranslations.py](RimWorld_CompareTranslations.py) you can compare two different translations.

With [RimWorld_FindUntranslated.py](RimWorld_FindUntranslated.py) you can find tags with unmodified texts.

With [RimWorld_TranslationUpgrader.py](RimWorld_TranslationUpgrader.py) you can transfer translated tags from a previous version to a new version, but comments won't be preserved.

The script [RimWorld_DefsToDefinjecteds.py](RimWorld_DefsToDefinjecteds.py) is no longer updated.
